		<p class="bluetext">When you are typing or putting elements on a page, try to keep the page neat, with indents and spacing. That way, you can follow your own code later.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="centering">
		<p>Also keep in mind how simple or complicated you are making your code. Too many div tags, especially nested ones, can make a mess.</p>
